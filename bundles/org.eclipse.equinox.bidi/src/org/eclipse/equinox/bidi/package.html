This package provides interfaces and classes for
processing complex expressions.


<h2>Introduction to Complex Expressions</h2>
<p>
Bidirectional text offers interesting challenges to presentation systems.
For plain text, the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
(<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UBA</a>)
generally specifies satisfactorily how to reorder bidirectional text for
display. This algorithm is implemented in Java's presentation system.</p>
<p>
However, all bidirectional text is not necessarily plain text. There
are also instances of text structured to follow a given syntax, which
should be reflected in the display order. The general algorithm, which
has no awareness of these special cases, often gives incorrect results
when displaying such structured text.</p>
<p>
The general idea in handling complex expressions is to add directional
formatting characters at proper locations in the text to supplement the
standard algorithm, so that the final result is correctly displayed
using the UBA.
A class which handles complex expressions is thus essentially a
transformation engine which receives text without directional formatting
characters as input and produces as output the same text with added
directional formatting characters, hopefully in the minimum quantity
which is sufficient to ensure correct display, considering the type of
complex expression involved.</p>
<p>
In this package, text without directional formatting characters is
called <b><i>lean</i></b> text while the text with added directional
formatting characters is called <b><i>full</i></b> text.</p>
<p>
The class {@link
<a href="BidiComplexHelper.html"><b>BidiComplexHelper</b></a>}
is the main tool for processing complex expressions.  It facilitates
handling several types of complex expressions, each type being handled
by a specific
{@link <a href="custom\IBidiComplexProcessor.html"><b><i>processor</i></b></a>} :</p>
<ul>
  <li>property (name=value)</li>
  <li>compound name (xxx_yy_zzzz)</li>
  <li>comma delimited list</li>
  <li>system(user)</li>
  <li>directory and file path</li>
  <li>e-mail address</li>
  <li>URL</li>
  <li>regular expression</li>
  <li>Xpath</li>
  <li>Java code</li>
  <li>SQL statements</li>
  <li>RTL arithmetic expressions</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other classes and one interface in this package may be used to
complement and facilitate the action of
{@link <a href="BidiComplexHelper.html">BidiComplexHelper</a>}:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="BidiComplexEnvironment.html">BidiComplexEnvironment</a>}
  which regroups details about the environment</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="BidiComplexFeatures.html">BidiComplexFeatures</a>}
      which allows viewing and manipulating some factors which affect
      a complex expression processor's behavior</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="BidiComplexUtil.html">BidiComplexUtil</a>}
      provides a number of convenience methods to process some common types of
      complex expressions.  When using methods in this class, there is no need
      to use other classes of this package.  However, the other classes allow
      more precise control and possibly better performance.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="IBidiComplexExpressionTypes.html">IBidiComplexExpressionTypes</a>}
      is an interface which contains only literals identifying the various types
      of complex expressions currently supported.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="BidiComplexStringRecord.html">BidiComplexStringRecord</a>}
      which allows to record strings which are complex expressions with their
      type, so that another module can check if a given string has been recorded
      as a complex expression and retrieve its type.</li>
</ul>
<p>
{@link <a href="BidiComplexHelper.html">BidiComplexHelper</a>} and the
other classes and interface mentioned above are intended for users who
need to process complex expressions for which there already exist
processors.
<p>
Developers who want to develop new processors to support types of complex
expressions not currently supported can use the following components of the
package {@link <a href="custom\package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.custom</a>}:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="custom\IBidiComplexProcessor.html">IBidiComplexProcessor</a>}
      is an interface specifying which methods a processor must provide.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="custom\BidiComplexProcessor.html">BidiComplexProcessor</a>}
      is a generic processor which can be used as superclass for specific
      processors.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="custom\BidiComplexStringProcessor.html">BidiComplexStringProcessor</a>}
      is a class which allows retrieval of the defined processor types and of the
      corresponding processors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are two other packages associated with the current one:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="internal\package-summary.html">
      org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal</a>}</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="internal\consumable\package-summary.html">
       org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal.consumable</a>}</li>
</ul>
The tools in the first package can serve as example of how to develop
processors for currently unsupported types of complex expressions.<br>
The latter package contains classes for the processors implementing
the currently supported types of complex expressions.
<p>
However, users wishing to process the currently supported types of
complex expressions typically don't need to interact with these
two packages.

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>The proposed solution is making extensive usage of LRM, RLM, LRE, RLE
and PDF directional controls which are invisible but affect the way bidi
text is displayed. The following related key points merit special
attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implementations of the UBA on various platforms (e.g., Windows and
Linux) are very similar but nevertheless have known differences. Those
differences are minor and will not have a visible effect in most cases.
However there might be cases in which the same bidi text on two
platforms might look different. These differences will surface in Java
applications when they use the platform visual components for their UI
(e.g., AWT, SWT).</li>

<li>It is assumed that the presentation engine supports LRE, RLE and
PDF directional formatting characters.</li>

<li>Because some presentation engines are not strictly conformant to the
UBA, the implementation of complex expressions in this package adds LRM
or RLM characters in association with LRE, RLE or PDF in cases where
this would not be needed if the presentation engine was fully conformant
to the UBA. Such added marks will not have harmful effects on
conformant presentation engines and will help less conformant engines to
achieve the desired presentation.</li>
</ul>
